Coherence:

Questions to ask in class:
1. Does a pause empty the context set ?

Non repetition:


1. When we say "does not contribute to coherence score", do we consider it both in negative and positive cases, where say we have 7 copies of the same item `["i1", "i1", "i1", "i1", "i1", "i1", "i1" ]` and obviously they have the same subjects so for the first instance of `i1`, and the context set has the same subjects for the first index so coherence goes up by 1. Then in the second instance,

 - do we ignore it because it is a repeating item ?
 - or do we reduce the coherence score by 1 as we ignore the subjects of all repeating items and the ?
